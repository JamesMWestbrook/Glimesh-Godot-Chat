Getting Started
In WebSocket.tscn, in the inspector you will see a key, in which you can enter a value. paste your app's client ID into that.

Either open map.tscn and run from there, or run any empty scene, and it should work.
You'll know it works becuase it doesn't immediately close the connection in the debug log.
